# CMSC 180 - Parallel Programming

### Interpolating the elevations into a higher resolution digital elevation matrix M given a lower resolution digital elevation matrix N

Extend the more efficient computer program that was written in Laboratory Exercise 02 to use threads to estimate the point elevation of a n x n matrix.

Transform the serial computer program into a threaded computer program.

## Running Instructions

Install numpy module (if not yet installed):
``` bash
$ pip install numpy 
```

Run python program:
``` bash
$ python3 main.py 
```
Input n size of nxn table:
```bash
$ 100
```
Input t threads:
```bash
$ 50
```
